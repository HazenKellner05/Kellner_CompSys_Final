Introduction:
The General Lotka-Volterra equation has been studied extensively since publication in the 1920s[2]. As such it has been explored and utilized far beyond the use case of large scale ecological systems that it was conceived to describe, such as in works published at the end of the last decade relating the equations to microbial interactions in the human gut microbiome [3]. With computational methods getting increasingly efficient, accessible, and capable, network models like the GLV equations are becoming increasingly useful and of interest for understanding systems level biological processes. The present paper describes a particularly unique use case of May-Lenoard’s special case of GLV for three negatively interacting species applied to interacting subnetworks of neurons. The full analysis performed in the original literature introduces this case of GLV in addition to a model of network activity that they developed in order to model the activity of three interacting populations of inhibitory neurons [1]. Although the full model cannot be observed without the addition of the stoichiometric population activations the full dynamics can’t be modeled consistent with the paper; However, using the details in the paper in conjunction with May-Leonards original publication [4] the GLV dynamics underlying the different end states of the proposed simulation can be illustrated. Three conditions are explored here, namely one ending in a stable equilibrium of activity between the three, a winner take all scenario, and finally an oscillatory behaviour.
